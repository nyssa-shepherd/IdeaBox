##### Idea Box
This project allows users to input an idea, interact with it, and save it to local storage. Once a user saves an idea, they have the opportunity to rate their ideas as one of three categories. Since the cards persist after page reload, users have the ability to interact with the cards at any point. 
The most challenging part of this project was updating our local storage key/value pairs to reflect changes in the qualities of the cards.
